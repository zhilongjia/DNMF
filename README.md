# Discriminant Non-Negative Matrix Factorization

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zhilongjia/DNMF.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zhilongjia/DNMF) [![CRAN Version](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/DNMF)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=DNMF)

Discriminant Non-Negative Matrix Factorization is to extend the Non-negative Matrix Factorization algorithm in order to extract features that enforce not only the spatial locality, but also the separability between classes in a discriminant manner. Two kinds of Discriminant Non-Negative Matrix Factorization were implemented so far.
